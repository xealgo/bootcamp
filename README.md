# Introduction
This is a guide designed to teach you what programming is, how to do it and what is means to be a programmer. In each section, numbered from 001, 002, ... 010, and so on, we'll uncover a new topic in programming, starting with the fundamentals and gradually work our way into the more advanced topics. Finally we'll dive into different branches of programming, from simple command line programs (often referred to as CLI "command-line-interface" apps) to simple games and from web servers to web pages. While this guide is intended to teach you how to program, it's also my goal to teach you what it means to be a programmer and so we'll also take a look at what some of the tools us programemrs use everyday and are expected to know in the modern work place.

## What Is Programming?
As a noun, programming is defined as "the action or process of writing computer programs" while as a verb we have "provide (a computer or other machine) with coded instructions for the automatic performance of a task". However, I feel these definitions completely fail to capture the true essence of programming. By the end of this guide, I hope to show you what programming truly means and what is is to be a programmer.

## Organization
We'll start with the very basics of how computers work, the software that's used to write and build programs and an overview of the concepts we'll be covering. At the end of each section you'll build the included sample program. Each folder will have this same `README.md` file. This is programmer 101 - You'll see README files everywhere you go and they literally mean what they said, READ ME! If you want to get the attention of a fellow programmer, this is how to do it.

## Markdown (How I wrote this README!)
Markdown is used everywhere in programming these days because it allows for extremely fast formatting without needing to constantly select text or press commands such as cmd-i, cmd-b, etc. on and off to toggle the format. Markdown can be read as plain text, but is often read using a markdown viewer such as the one built into most modern IDEs (we'll learn what these are in section 001). 

See https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet for a guide in writing markdown files.
